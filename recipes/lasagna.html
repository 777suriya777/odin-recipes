    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a favorite comfort food worldwide. It is made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich and flavorful fillings, including meat or vegetable-based sauces, creamy ricotta or b√©chamel, and plenty of melted cheese, such as mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish is then baked to golden perfection, creating a harmonious blend of textures and flavors. Originating from Italy's Emilia-Romagna region, lasagna is versatile, allowing for variations like vegetarian, seafood, or even gluten-free versions. It is often enjoyed as a hearty meal, perfect for family gatherings or special occasions, evoking warmth and satisfaction with every bite.</p>
