    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ven Pongal is a traditional and beloved South Indian breakfast dish made with rice and moong dal (yellow split lentils). It is a savory, comfort food that is simple to prepare yet packed with flavor. The dish is typically tempered with a mixture of black pepper, cumin seeds, ginger, and curry leaves, giving it a fragrant and mildly spicy flavor. Cashews are added for crunch, and ghee (clarified butter) is generously poured over the top to enhance the richness.</p>
    <p>Ven Pongal is often served with sambar (a spicy lentil stew) and coconut chutney, making it a wholesome and satisfying meal. It is commonly eaten during festivals, special occasions, or as part of a traditional South Indian breakfast. Its combination of soft rice and dal with aromatic spices makes it both nourishing and delicious.</p>
