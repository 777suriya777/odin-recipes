    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sambar is a popular South Indian dish that is a flavorful and nutritious lentil-based stew. It is made with cooked lentils (usually toor dal or split pigeon peas), a variety of vegetables like drumsticks, carrots, pumpkins, and okra, and a tangy tamarind base. The dish is seasoned with a unique blend of spices, typically prepared using sambar powder, which contains roasted and ground spices like coriander seeds, cumin, fenugreek, and dried red chilies.</p>
    <p>The preparation is completed with a tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, dried red chilies, and asafoetida (hing), which is added for an aromatic finish. Sambar is a versatile dish and can be paired with steamed rice, idli, dosa, or vada, making it a staple in South Indian cuisine. Its tangy, spicy, and mildly sweet flavors create a perfect harmony, making it both a comforting everyday meal and a delightful dish for festive occasions.</p>
